### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorites because of how effective, yet simple it was. The "hello world" is what most programmers use as their introduction into the world of coding. I felt like I actually accomplished something, despite looking back on it and seeing just how easy it is to make.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was another one of my favorites because it was so challenging. I felt like once I figured out how to implement the number cards and face cards I gained a ton of knowledge. It for sure pushed me to become a better programmer.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 is when I really became interested in perfecting my code. It was really interesting to see the final product come to life, having it ask me for a secret number then guess it. Despite it being sort-of bare bones, this lab also pushed me to utilize the debugging flowchart.
